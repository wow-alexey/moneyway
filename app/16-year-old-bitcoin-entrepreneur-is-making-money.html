                <p>DURBAN - Elisha Owusu Akyaw, a 16 year old high school student is making money because of
                    bitcoin.</p>
                <p>Akyaw is the Chief Executive Officer of Token Media, a cryptocurrency marketing firm that he created
                    last year.</p>
                <p>The firm was set up to help blockchain projects with their target audience. The business is small,
                    but he has worked with local financial firms to develop their projects.</p>
                <p>His business according to Bitcoinafrica.io has assisted in raising over $40 million in token sales
                    through its marketing services.</p>
                <p>Akyaw was interested in technology at the age of 12 after he got a mobile device that could connect
                    to the internet.
                </p>
                <p>By exploring the internet he was able to develop a website by himself.
                </p>
                <p>One of the first creations was a commercial blog for Firefox OS, Mozilla's mobile operating system
                    (firefoxcentral.com).
                </p>
                <p>When the project ended Akyaw had to move into other areas of the internet which is when he discovered
                    cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and bitcoin.
                </p>
                <p>"I got into the tech space sometime in 2013. I had my second phone after using a Nokia 3310 so I got
                    access to the internet and began to explore what mobile phones, operating systems and websites were
                    all about and in 2014 I learned how to create websites on my own through YouTube".
                </p>
                <p>Africa is currently experiencing bitcoin fever. A report by Citibank ranked Kenya as the fifth
                    highest holder per capita in the world.
                </p>
                <p>In third place was Nigeria and South Africa was in sixth place.
                </p>
                <p>The increasing interest in bitcoin has been affected significantly by the high unemployment rate in
                    Africa.
                </p>
                <p>For Akyaw, it seems that combining his education and entrepreneurship is just a piece of the hurdles
                    he faces as an entrepreneur.
                </p>
                <p>At the moment, Akyaw is putting together a blockchain event with a big focus on cryptocurrency to
                    bring about discussions on regulations and the future of cryptocurrency in Africa.
                </p>
                <p>"The future of cryptocurrencies in Africa is bright as it has moved from just being currencies into
                    various useful platforms that will be essential to the African continent. Iâ€™m currently working on
                    putting together an event on cryptocurrencies with a particular focus on regulations, the future of
                    cryptocurrencies and how they can help Africa".
                </p>
                <p>Ghana is slowly catching up with the bitcoin fever as the country hosted their first blockchain
                    conference last year November.
