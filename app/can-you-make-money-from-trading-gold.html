                    <p>Can you make money from trading in gold?</p>

                    <p>With an increasing number of technology startups diversifying and innovating in a number of
                        different
                        industries within the financial sector, this has in turn, has opened up many ways that retail
                        <a href="http://gyiba.voluumtrk.com/click">consumers can make a little bit of cash on the side.</a></p>

                    <p>Tomorrow Xtrade, the first smart trading technology platform that allows customers to invest in
                        physical gold and use this as a long term source of income, will launch in London.</p>

                    <p>The mobile app provides information such as gold investment news, trade recommendations and
                        charts
                        and is the first gold provider that operates as an agency, rather than owing its own gold.</p>

                    <p>What this means is that Xtrade is completely aligned with the interests of customers and the
                        smart
                        trading algorithms can connect users with the world's biggest gold peer-to-peer markets in five
                        global units, in London, Zurich, New York, Toronto and Singapore.</p>

                    <p>These algorithms identify the optimal locations and market combination at any given time, which
                        results in average savings of 8-12 percent on all gold purchases and sells. While Xtrade lets
                        customers to invest to gain profits in the long-term, the company also understands that some may
                        want it to be liquid instantly.</p>

                    <p>The platform also provides customers with the first pre-paid branded MasterCard that allows gold
                        to
                        be turned into cash, as the card is linked to the value of the physical vaulted gold.</p>

                    <p>Sylvia Carrasco, CEO of Xtrade said: "The current gold establishment is pretty old-fashioned and
                        with Xtrade we are completely reinventing the way gold is being purchased and sold.</p>


                    <p>"We are making it fair and transparent for <a href="http://gyiba.voluumtrk.com/click">people who want to own gold.</a> Whilst our app is easy to
                        use, our business model and revolutionary technology ensures that our customers always get the
                        best
                        trading deals.</p>

                    <p>"There is a real FinTech revolution going on and we have also seen the arrival of a new
                        generation of
                        gold providers. However, ultimately, there has been no real change in the status quo: gold
                        investor
                        still suffer abusive practices because there is no financial regulator supervising the
                        market.</p>

                    <p>"We see a huge opportunity for gold as an asset, according to the World Gold Council, the global
                        investment demand for gold has grown at an average of 18% per year since 2000 and physical gold
                        is
                        currently trading about $200 billion a day."</p>

                    <p>Gold has been a popular source of income for many for centuries, but in recent years, it has
                        become
                        easier and easier for retail customers to <a href="http://gyiba.voluumtrk.com/click">buy and sell</a> the metal, as it would be with any
                        security.</p>

                    <p>Whether the stock market crashes or inflation takes off, gold has always maintained its status as
                        a
                        tangible asset, but because of this, it is not as useful because it cannot be sold easily.</p>

                    <p>However, in conversation with Xtrade Founder and CEO Sylvia Carrasco, she said that "Gold
                        ownership
                        is growing in popularity and becoming mainstream: As a resuly, buillon providers are currently
                        reporting record year-on-year growth.</p>

                    <p>"Google confirms this upward trend with nearly five million searches of the term “gold as an
                        investment” on mobile devices alone during April 2018 versus 2.6 million in January 2016. During
                        the
                        same period and for the same keywords, YouTube reported an increase of over 50%.</p>

                    <p>"In 2017, $165 billion was spent in physical gold, of which $42 billion was used to purchase bars
                        and
                        coins and $8bn in ETFs. In the UK alone, The Royal Mint estimates that there is $4 billion
                        untapped
                        demand for gold investments in physical gold bars and coins.</p>

                    <p>"Over the past 18 months the rise of cryptocurrency trading has also validated the market need
                        for an
                        alternative to traditional currencies. Xtrade value proposition fits perfectly in this space by
                        offering all the incentives and none of the risks associated to</p>

                    <p>them."</p>
