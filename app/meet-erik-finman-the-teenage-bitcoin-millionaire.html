                <p><strong>Finman used his fortune to fund an educational business – and he’s not as awful as he seems
                    on Instagram</strong></p>
                <p>Erik Finman is one of the world’s youngest bitcoin millionaires – an achievement he’s not shy about
                    flaunting. The 19-year-old’s Instagram feed is full of ostentatious photos of himself stepping out
                    of
                    private jets or lying on beds covered in money with captions like: “Cash so worthless compared to
                    Bitcoin I’m sleeping on it …”</p>
                <p>In one photo he is pictured smoking, with the caption: “Sometimes you just need a good smoke to relax
                    when you have to live with the exhausting burden of so much money and too many beautiful women.”
                    After
                    one of his fans admonishes him, he replies: “Don’t worry guys. It’s not a real cigarette. Just a
                    hundred. Don’t smoke!”</p>
                <p>
                    The teenager, who first bought bitcoin at age 12 with $1,000 from his grandmother, styles himself in
                    a
                    similar vein to the notorious Martin Shkreli; he’s just younger and not in jail.</p>
                <p>
                    However, all is not as it seems with Finman. Far from being a vapid bitcoin bro, he admits his
                    social
                    media presence is a carefully calculated front. “I think being a provocateur is a fun way to get
                    people
                    to pay attention to my ideas,” he tells me over the phone from his current base in San Francisco.
                    “You
                    see the reaction to it, people go crazy. But that helps draw attention to the actual world-changing
                    projects that I want to do.”</p>

                <p>
                    Finman first heard about bitcoin when his older brother took him to an Occupy Wall Street protest.
                    He
                    fell in love with the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrency, he says. An early adopter, Finman
                    bought his first bitcoin when it only cost around $10. Just a few years later, it hit around $1,100.
                    Finman sold $100,000 worth of bitcoin when the currency was on the up and, at age 15, used the money
                    to
                    start an online educational business called Botangle, which matched students with tutors via video
                    chat.
                    He was inspired to start the business, he says, because he had “a terrible school life”. One teacher
                    told him to drop out and work at McDonalds while another held an “Erik Finman roast session” where
                    students were encouraged to make fun of him. Despite his business success, his parents wouldn’t let
                    him
                    completely drop out of school. So he made a bet with them: if he made $1m before turning 18, he
                    wouldn’t
                    have to attend college. He won that bet last year. </p>
                <p> Education is a big deal for the Finman family. His parents met at Stanford while getting their
                    doctorates in electrical engineering and physics and his entire family, he says, is very smart. “I
                    think
                    of them as the Elon Musk version of the Kardashians,” he says. His mom was involved in Nasa in the
                    1980s
                    and, Finman says, “almost became an astronaut on the Challenger mission”. However, she got pregnant
                    with
                    Finman’s brother and, luckily, avoided the tragic launch. Apart from his experiences with high
                    school,
                    Finman seemed to have an idyllic childhood. He grew up on a llama farm in Idaho, for one thing. “We
                    had
                    one llama called Sausage who unfortunately got turned into a sausage,” he reminisces.
                </p>
                <div class="illustration">
                        <img src="img/bnd2.jpg" alt="illustration">
                    </div>
                <p>
                    In 2015, Finman made his best business move: he sold Botangle’s technology. The buyer offered him
                    either
                    300 bitcoin or $100,000 cash – he opted for the bitcoin. At the time it was a gamble, as bitcoin had
                    dipped and were worth around $200. Even though the currency continues to fluctuate wildly (I spoke
                    to
                    Finman shortly after the South
                    Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail was hacked, causing the value of
                    bitcoin to plummet 10% to two-month lows) he’s still made good on his investment. One bitcoin is now
                    worth around $6,500. Finman has 401 bitcoin as well as various other cryptocurrencies and continues
                    to
                    bet on its future. “Bitcoin will either be nothing or everything, and I think it will be more
                    everything. Or crypto will, at least,” he said.</p>
                <p>
                    Like his mother, Finman is also interested in space exploration. He’s currently working on a project
                    with Nasa to launch a satellite containing a digital time capsule into space. The capsule will
                    contain
                    popular music and videos as well as other representative sounds of life on earth, and a Taylor Swift
                    CD.
                    Why Taylor Swift? “We just reached out to her out of the blue, and she was into it,” Finman shrugs.
                    The
                    project is meant to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Voyager launch, which carried the
                    “Golden
                    Record”, a compilation of music and images from Earth, curated by the astronomer Carl Sagan, into
                    space
                    as a gift for any extraterrestrials who might stumble across it.</p>
                <p>
                    Sending satellites into space might be enough to occupy one person, but not Finman. The entrepreneur
                    has
                    a number of projects on the go. He recently
                    created a robot suit based on the four-armed contraption
                    worn by Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man for a 10-year-old child with hypermobility issues. The child,
                    Aristou Meehan, is the son of one of Finman’s mentors, and wanted his own Doctor Octopus suit to
                    help
                    “solve his problems”. So Finman made it for him. “I wish someone would have helped me like that when
                    I
                    was his age,” he says. There has already been some interest by investors in adapting the suit for
                    various uses, says Finman, but he’s moved on from it. Right now his big project is building a
                    physical
                    school and disrupting education. He’s tight-lipped on the actual details: “I’m still in early
                    stages.”</p>

                    </div>
                <p>While Finman’s social media presence may be satire, he’s still rich and young. Doesn’t he ever go a
                    little off the rails? “Oh yes, I got a fast car, did all that,” Finman says. “Traveled all over the
                    world. Went a little crazy. Made a couple of stops in Ibiza and Monaco. I had to get it out of my
                    system, you know.” He’s also been careful to make sure his former teachers know about his success.
                    “I remember when the first article [about me] came out, I sent it to the worst teacher I had. The
                    subject heading just said ‘look at me now bitch’.” Finman put a tracking pixel in the email so he
                    knows the teacher opened it. “But I didn’t hear back.”</p>
