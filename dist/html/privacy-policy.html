                <p><strong>1. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER</strong></p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of GoViral Inc. (“themoneyway.info”, "we", "our" or "us") on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on and obtained through <a href="http://themoneyway.info">http://themoneyway.info</a> <strong>or any or its subsites (together the “Website” or “Site”)</strong>, any application made available by themoneyway.info through the Apple App Store, Google Play Store or similar (each an <strong>“App”</strong>) and the services, features, content, mobile applications and or other related sources we offer (collectively with the Website and Apps, the "Services"). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your "Account"); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. <br>                This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, such as Google, and Facebook ("Third Party Services") that you elect to access through the Service. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>
                <p><strong>2. WHY WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
                <p>We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, to personalize and improve the Services, for marketing purposes and such other purposes which we may inform you of by updating this privacy policy from time to time or as otherwise set out in this . We will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us on signing up for the Services or contacting us with questions or for further information and we will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed below), unless you explicitly agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.</p>
                <p><strong>3. PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</strong></p>
                <p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like what content you might prefer to see</p>
                <p><strong>3.1 Information we collect automatically</strong></p>
                <p>Information that we collect automatically may include, your IP address, an ID that we may create and associate with our content, cookie information, and other details, and we describe this in more detail below. This information is used for fighting spam/malware, to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on and shared with others, including via email and social media), and to otherwise personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. We may associate the information we collect by automated means with your IP address, the device you use to connect to the Services identifiers provided to us by Third Party Providers, or email or social media accounts that you use to share our content.<br>                    To opt-out of data collection concerning the links you have shared with others, please <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">click here</a>.<br>                    Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site or mobile application. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.<br>                Type of information that we collect automatically includes:</p>
                <p><strong>3.1.1 Device information</strong></p>
                <p>We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number where applicable). We may associate your device identifiers.</p>
                <p><strong>3.1.2 Log information</strong></p>
                <p>When you use our services, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>details of how you used our service.</li>
                    <li>Internet protocol address.</li>
                    <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser</li>
                    <li>language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
                    <li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3.1.3 Unique application numbers</strong></p>

                <p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Us when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.4 Local storage</strong></p>

                <p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash cookies or HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.5 Cookies and similar technologies</strong></p>

                <p>When you visit our website or otherwise interact with the Service we (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may send one or more “cookies” to your computer or other devices. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored on your computer through your web browser and are used by most websites to help personalize your web experience. Some cookies may facilitate additional site features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analyzing usage for site optimization, providing custom content, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our site. <br>                We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but some features on the site will not function properly. <br>                Functional cookies, persistent and session type, store information to enable core site functionality. <br>                Analytics cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site and our marketing campaigns. <br>                Advertising cookies may be set through our website by our advertising partners. Data may be collected by these companies that enable them to serve up advertisements on other sites that are relevant to your interests.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.6 Web Beacons</strong></p>

                <p>We (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may use Web Beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our Service, or other information we or they have collected. Web Beacons are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. Web Beacons may be used within the Service to track web page visits, email open rates and other information about the user. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to our Users’ Personal Information. For example, we use clear gifs on our webpages to let us know which content the user prefers. This allows us to improve the user experience and gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.7 Analytics Software</strong></p>

                <p>We and our third party tracking-utility partners use log files on our Service to gather certain information automatically and store it for analytical purposes. This information includes internet protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Service and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google's practices by going to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.8 Information from third party sources</strong></p>

                <p>Depending on where you are located and the provisions of local laws, we may also store certain information about you that we or our third party services providers collect about you indirectly from other sources. These may include information collected about you: (i) in order to prevent fraud, such as by using the services offered by Forensiq (<a href="https://impact.com/privacy-policy/">https://impact.com/privacy-policy/</a>); or (ii) collecting certain demographic information about you based on links, advertisements or similar to any or our sites. We store this information only against identifiers created by us (which may include IP addresses), but do not link this information back to a name, email address or other easily recognizable unique identifier. These third party providers may also collate information about you on a similar basis, and you should refer to their terms of service and privacy policies in this respect.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.9 Do not track</strong></p>

                <p>When you visit the Site, we may also collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not- track ("DNT") mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.</p>

                <p><strong>3.2 USER CONTENT</strong></p>

                <p>Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services. The Services are designed to allow us to share such content with others. As a result, some of the provided content is shared publicly or with third parties. Therefore, all content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us for as long as we require it in relation to the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, subject to applicable laws. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p><strong>3.3 LOCATION DATA</strong></p>

                <p>Some of our Services, such as mobile applications, may collect geo- location data (which determines your current location) to provide location- related Service functionality. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. You may stop sharing your location data by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instruction on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.</p>

                <p><strong>3.4 EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>

                <p>If you email us, we will store that information. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our Services, including customer service.</p>

                <p><strong>3.5 ADVERTISERS</strong></p>

                <p>To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called "ad networks." Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may engage with ad networks that are members or organizations or programs that manage the advertising privacy choices these ad networks offer consumers. To learn more about the cookies that we use for our ad networks and to adjust your preferences, please <a href="https://diply.com/static/storedcookies">click here</a>. If you are using an IP address that indicates that you are located in the EU, we may ask for your consent before providing certain Personal Information to those advertising networks. <br>                When you visit our Site or use our mobile applications or other Services, ad networks and other parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and other parties. <br>                Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category, which may be inferred from information provided to us by a user, may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use other than in connection with the Services. <br>                Without limiting the above, we may use the following third-party Service Providers to show advertisements to you to help support and maintain our Service. <br></p>

                <p><strong>3.5.1 Google AdSense DoubleClick Cookie</strong></p>

                <p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our Service. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our Service or other websites on the Internet. <br>                You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick Cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the Google Ads Settings web page: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a></p>

                <p><strong>5.4 Important Exceptions</strong></p>

                <p><strong> 5.4.1 <em>Information We Share for Our Protection, the Protection of Others and as Required by Law</em></strong></p>

                <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other Website members, other users of the Services, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities. Further, we may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention. Notwithstanding the general terms of this policy, the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information may be made outside of the terms herein to the extent provided for in any applicable privacy or other legislation in effect from time to time, or pursuant to court orders.</p>

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information, including Personal Information, is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur as permitted by law. Following the transfer of user information in the circumstances described in this paragraph, all inquiries concerning the processing of user information should be directed to the entity to which the information is transferred.</p>

Users may make privacy choices by selecting options within App settings or their account. Your default privacy settings tend to be the most privacy friendly settings that allow for the least amount of sharing. In any event, users should review their privacy settings to ensure they reflect their expectations. Users should keep the privacy choices they have made in mind and avoid posting information they do not want to be shared in light of those choices.</p>

We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps designed to protect Personal Information that you provide to us.

                <p>Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction. <br>                If you provide information to us, please note that we host data using third party providers (such as Google BigQuery) and may transfer the data, including Personal Information, to another jurisdiction other than your own (including a jurisdiction outside of the EU) and process it there. <br>                Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. <br>                themoneyway.info will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Information will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>
